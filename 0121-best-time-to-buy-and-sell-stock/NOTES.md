The main logic is that we know that if we have to maximise the profit then we want to
buy  stock in which price is less and when price is high  we want to sell.
we  first buy on first day  because we cna't sell on that day
now on every element traversal we  have to buy and sell both and store it
if the cost earlier we buy is higher than current then we replae it with another buying cost
and every time we check what profit we earn by these and return the max one
â€‹
and one thing  is common on every single day except first one we have to buy or sell
